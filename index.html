                        project on time
                        and on budget?
                    </p>
                    <p class="top-text">
                        Turns out, the answer is quite straightforward. Proper research and planning before tackling the
                        software project help greatly.

                        In this article, we will look at a crucial part of every software project that can help your
                        project
                        succeed to launch in the required deadline: the discovery phase.

                    <h2 class="post-page-h2">What is a discovery phase?</h2>
                    <p>A discovery phase is a consultancy product that helps the client do the right thing with his
                        business. In more detail, it is a phase that generates a comprehensive plan for the rest of the
                        development process. The plan includes things like functional and technical requirements, scope
                        estimates, and a release plan.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="post-text">
                    <h2 class="post-page-markup">But it doesn’t mean that you should plan your whole project in one go
                    </h2>
                    <p>Our approach to the discovery phase is to focus only on the most important functionality and
                        provide the customer with the necessary extent of detail to begin the development.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Low-priority functionality is usually subject to big changes. That’s why trying to describe it
                        from the start results in a waste of time. Additionally, low-priority functionality can be
                        discussed and detailed during the development stage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This approach is aimed at maximizing product value, saving time and reducing the cost of both
                        the discovery and development phases.

                    </h2>
                    <p>The discovery phase is most relevant when there are no exact requirements and the vision of work
                        to be done is not as clear as it could be. At the same time, the discovery phase is a way for
                        the client to understand how the software partner works and make sure they are the right fit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here are some of the indicators we take in mind when deciding whether to offer a discovery phase
                        before development. Let’s look at two possible projects: a startup and an enterprise business.

                <div class="post-text">
                    <h3 class="post-page-h3">Startup </h3>
                    <p>Startups can sometimes have gaps in the description of the product. These include missing corner
                        cases, user scenarios, and integrations that have not been considered. In addition, it is
                        important to find a target audience to focus on. Proper discovery can help with all of these
                        things
                    </p>

                <div class="post-text">
                    <h3 class="post-page-h3">Enterprise</h3>
                    <p>For business customers, it is important to go through a discovery phase if they lack in-house
                        expertise regarding development technologies and are not experienced with creating custom
                        products. Our team can research the company, delve deep into its processes, and provide a fresh
                        perspective that’s at the intersection of what is possible and what is affordable.

                    <h2 class="post-page-h2">What do you do during a discovery phase? </h2>
                    <p>During the discovery phase, it is important to dive deep into the domain of the project and the
                        target audience. Knowledge about the end-user helps project managers and developers to
                        understand who the product must be tailored for and which problems it should solve.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Based on this information, consultants can develop a high-level product vision and prepare a
                        high-level diagram based on user needs and problems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By going into more detail, they can build a product development backlog that solves real user
                        stories. Furthermore, research informs them about stories they should prioritize both from a
                        technical and business standpoint.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Any necessary technical requirements for the project, such as hosting, 3rd party accounts, etc.,
                        are also prepared during the discovery phase.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the end, all this information is gathered into a project plan.
